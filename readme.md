This project is to control the pump connected to our water tank using a Raspberry Pi. The pump is activated when the bottom tank is full & shut off when it is empty.

##Website
This webiste is hosted on the RPi. It can display the state of the tanks & pump, the logs and pump history and any errors that are present. There is also the ability to eneable & disable the pump & clear any errors through the web interface.
